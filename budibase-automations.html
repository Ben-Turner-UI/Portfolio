            <p>As an in-house Product Designer at Budibase, I was tasked with redesigning a core part of our platform. Budibase is an open-source, low-code platform that enables businesses to rapidly build custom applications like customer portals, admin panels, and internal tools.</p>

            <p>As the company launched a major new software version, it began a strategic shift toward long-term, sustainable growth. A key part of this strategy was to drive revenue by enhancing Automations, the powerful workflows that connect different apps and services. I led the design for this initiative, starting with a paid research study of 30 users to gather the data needed to guide the project and ensure it aligned with our new business goals.</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>The existing workflow builder was functional, but it was difficult for users to debug and test their automations. This usability friction was a barrier to adoption and increased the volume of customer support requests, which hindered the company's goal of driving revenue through this core feature.</p>

                    <h3>User-Centric Research</h3>
                    <p>I used Maze, a user testing platform, to design and run a paid research study with 30 active users. By analysing their feedback and the quantitative data, a clear pattern emerged: the main problems were poor data visibility and unclear error messages. Users consistently highlighted a need for a better debugging experience, more intuitive testing, and a cleaner overall interface.</p>

                <p>This project was a prime example of how targeted user research can solve critical business problems. By translating deep user insights into an actionable design strategy, I led a change that not only improved the user experience but also aligned the product with key business objectives. The improvements provided the essential groundwork for the company's next major strategic shift: integrating AI into the heart of the platform, positioning Budibase for its next phase of growth.</p>
