          <p class="header-info-title">Client Description:</p>
          <p>Budibase is an open-source low-code platform designed to help teams build internal tools quickly. As the company evolved, automation became a key area of focus — and that meant ensuring the experience was as intuitive and powerful as possible.

        <div class="project-overview">
          <p class="header-info-title">Project Overview:</p>
          <p>As Budibase leaned more heavily into automation, I recognised a big gap — I hadn't yet asked users what they actually thought of the experience. There was no structured feedback or research around what was working, what wasn't, or what users needed next. So, I proposed and ran a paid qualitative user study using Maze — the first of its kind at Budibase for automations. The insights I gathered led directly to a major UX overhaul of the automation builder, focusing on clarity, debugging, and data visibility.

            <div class="project-paragraph">
              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>Budibase was expanding its automation capabilities, but I didn't have enough clarity on how people were actually using them. I was building features based mostly on assumptions and indirect feedback.</p>
              <p>I needed insights into what problems users were trying to solve, what challenges they ran into, and which improvements would have the biggest impact. This would help me bridge the gap between what was being built and what was really needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-image">

              <figcaption>Survey responses highlighted key pain points around automation — particularly debugging failures and understanding data flow.</figcaption>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>User Research</h3>
                  <p>I designed and launched a paid Maze study targeting real Budibase automation users. The survey asked contextual, open-ended questions like "How would you rate your experience building an automation from scratch?" and "What was the most confusing or frustrating part of the process?" I also asked users to link their Budibase app so I could better understand their use cases and behaviours. We collected responses from 20 highly relevant participants — a solid benchmark for qualitative usability studies.

                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Synthesis & Internal Collaboration</h3>
                  <p>Once I had the results, I pulled together a report and shared it with leadership — including the CEO, CTO and CMO. I used the data to align on a roadmap and define what changes needed to be prioritised based on what users actually cared about.</p>
                </div>

              <div class="project-paragraph-list">
                <h2>User Experience Improvements</h2>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Error Messaging</h3>
                  <p>Introduced proper error reporting with clearer in-app explanations to help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>State Feedback</h3>
                  <p>Each automation step now shows real-time state, giving users visibility into what's happening at every stage of their automation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Data In/Data Out</h3>
                  <p>Users can now see exactly what data is entering and exiting each step, making it easier to debug and understand their automation flow.</p>
                </div>

              <p>These were highly targeted changes designed to directly solve the top frustrations raised in the research.</p>

            <div class="project-paragraph">
              <h2>Final Solution</h2>
              <p>The new automation experience is more user-friendly, transparent, and easier to troubleshoot. While we didn't track numerical satisfaction scores, internal testing and community feedback strongly suggested that users were encountering fewer blockers and had more visibility throughout the process.</p>

                  <h3>Real User Insights</h3>
                  <p>This was the first time we'd run a dedicated automation UX study at Budibase. It created a stronger feedback loop between our users and the product team, and helped validate our assumptions with data.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Informed Roadmap Decisions</h3>
                  <p>The findings gave us a clear, evidence-backed path forward — ensuring we worked on problems that actually mattered to users.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Improved Internal Alignment</h3>
                  <p>By involving leadership early in the findings process, we built stronger internal consensus and avoided back-and-forth around design priorities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Fewer Support Queries</h3>
                  <p>Community channels and internal feedback showed a noticeable drop in repeated questions about common automation issues after the improvements were released.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="project-paragraph">
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>This project was a turning point for how we approached user feedback at Budibase. It proved that even a small-scale, well-designed study could uncover valuable insights and drive meaningful product change.</p>
              <p>It also reinforced the value of design-led research — not just as a way to validate ideas, but as a powerful tool for shaping them. The automation builder is now more intuitive, more robust, and better aligned with how our users actually work.</p>
