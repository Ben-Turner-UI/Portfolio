          <p>I was assigned by CityFibre to lead and manage a crucial UX workshop for 40 participants. The challenge was to find innovative ways to use Typeform and Figma to enhance the user experience for leading ISPs like Vodafone, TalkTalk, and Zen in the absence of a budget for a mainstream UX testing tool.

              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>The critical challenge presented was to research, analyse, and subsequently enhance the user experience of CityFibre's backend portal - a tool of paramount importance employed by leading Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for booking engineers for home fibre installation surveys. Given the high-stakes nature of our stakeholders, which included major industry players like Vodafone and TalkTalk, it was essential to deliver an outstanding UX testing experience. The success of this endeavour was not only vital to improving the tool's functionality but was also instrumental in fostering a strong relationship with our prominent partners.</p>

              <div class="project-paragraph-list">
                <h2>Approach and Solution</h2>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Part 1 - UX Survey</h3>
                  <p>I developed an interactive survey using Typeform and Figma. The survey guided users through the website while posing crucial usability questions. This strategy provided actionable insights, similar to the output of an AB test.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Part 2 - Interactive Feedback Sessions</h3>
                  <p>I also organised feedback sessions to show the ISPs the latest portal designs and to gather their opinions on potential new features. These sessions offered essential suggestions that greatly improved the portal's user experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>UX Test Execution</h3>
                  <p>ISPs were invited to CityFibre's offices to experience the new system first-hand. I managed the workshop by dividing the participants into teams, with each team independently navigating through the survey without any complications. The execution of this survey was so successful that even participants who weren't tech-savvy and struggled with using computers were able to complete the survey with a completion rate of 100%.</p>

                  <h3>Gathered Comprehensive User Insights</h3>
                  <p>The innovative approach I adopted allowed us to gather over 1,400 individual metrics and feedback data points. This wealth of information has been instrumental in informing the business about our stakeholder priorities.</p>

                  <h3>Increased Stakeholder Confidence</h3>
                  <p>The success of the UX testing workshop significantly bolstered stakeholder confidence. My role in driving improvements, based on the feedback from the workshop, played a pivotal role in this uplift.</p>

                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Strengthened ISP and Partner Relations</h3>
                  <p>The smooth and successful execution of the workshop not only served its primary purpose but also strengthened our relationships with key ISPs and partners. They have expressed greater confidence in collaborations moving forward, a testament to my ability to deliver results.</p>

This experience serves as a reliable reference point for what I can achieve in the digital design space.</p>

                <p>This project demonstrated the value of adaptability, innovative thinking, and agile methodologies.
