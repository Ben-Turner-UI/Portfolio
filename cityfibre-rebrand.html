              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>CityFibre aimed to overhaul its digital image into something more contemporary, inclusive, and challenger. The goals were to enhance user experience, improve accessibility, and differentiate themselves from key industry players like Virgin Media and British Telecom.</p>

                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Rebranding & Redesign</h3>
                  <p>My initial step was updating our design systems within Figma to align with CityFibre's latest brand guidelines. Following this, I redesigned each block of the website to ensure a consistent and eye-catching digital presence. 
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Research & Ideation</h3>
                  <p>I thoroughly examined CityFibre's branding objectives to fully understand their vision. This insight empowered me to deliver a rebranding strategy that not only aligned with their vision but also made CityFibre distinguishable in a saturated market.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Implementation & Handover</h3>
                  <p>Efficiency and compatibility with our key tools, including CraftCMS and Tailwind CSS, were central to the implementation process. I enhanced our design systems and processes for superior developer handovers. This new system revolutionised our design handover process, leading to a substantial increase in our Jira right-first-time rating from 75% to 95%.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>User Experience Improvements</h3>
                  <p>Aiming to improve accessibility and usability, I managed to implement the brand's challenging neon-dominated colour scheme while adhering to double-A standard accessibility. This balance ensured an engaging, user-friendly experience without compromising on design aesthetics.</p>

            <div class="project-paragraph">
              <h2>Final Solution</h2>

                  <h3>Improved Developer Handovers</h3>
                  <p>My new design system significantly enhanced the quality of developer handovers, improving our Jira right-first-time rating to 95%. This efficient process change led to smoother project implementation, reducing potential back-and-forth revisions.</p>

                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Distinctive Brand Identity</h3>
                  <p>The rebrand's vibrant colour scheme and contemporary aesthetics distinguished CityFibre, making it an eye-catching option for potential customers. Customers found CityFibre to standout much more than competitor products thanks to the vibrant and colourful rebranding.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Higher Conversion Rate</h3>
                  <p>In addition to the rebrand, I included many UX journey improvements throughout the site, including improving key conversations through the websites postcode availability checker, which checks if people can have fibre broadband installed at their home. As a result of these changes, we increased conversions by over 200% in key areas thus providing business value for CityFibre partners. </p>

                <div class="project-paragraph-list-item">
                  <h3>Boost in Business Opportunities</h3>
                  <p>As an important testament to the success of the rebrand, we gained new business opportunities, affirming the effectiveness of my design work.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Leading the CityFibre project highlighted the importance of an efficient and well-executed digital rebrand and performance optimisation. By building a design system compatible with our developer toolset (CraftCMS and Tailwind CSS), I was able to enhance both the development process and the final product. This project has significantly enriched my skillset as a product designer, equipping me to handle larger, more impactful projects in the future.</p>
